# Architecture

Core system architecture, execution model, and convergence guarantees.

## Documents

- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** — High-level system architecture and layers
- **[ENGINE_EXECUTION_MODEL.md](./ENGINE_EXECUTION_MODEL.md)** — How the engine executes agents and detects convergence
- **[CONVERGENCE_SEMANTICS.md](./CONVERGENCE_SEMANTICS.md)** — What convergence means and how it's guaranteed
- **[CONVERGENCE_PROOFS.md](./CONVERGENCE_PROOFS.md)** — Informal proofs of convergence guarantees
- **[ROOT_INTENT_SCHEMA.md](./ROOT_INTENT_SCHEMA.md)** — Schema for Root Intent (entry point)
- **[FAILURE_MODES.md](./FAILURE_MODES.md)** — How the system handles failures
- **[SCALING_MODEL.md](./SCALING_MODEL.md)** — How Converge scales

## Quick Start

1. Start with **ARCHITECTURE.md** for system overview
2. Read **ENGINE_EXECUTION_MODEL.md** to understand execution
3. Study **CONVERGENCE_SEMANTICS.md** for convergence guarantees
