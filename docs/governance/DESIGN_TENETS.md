# Design Tenets — Converge
## One-Page Principles

These tenets define what Converge *is*.

They are non-negotiable.

---

## 1. Explicit Authority
Every root intent has a single semantic authority.
Nothing decides implicitly.

---

## 2. Convergence Over Control Flow
The system progresses by reaching a fixed point,
not by executing predefined steps.

---

## 3. Append-Only Truth
Facts are added, never mutated.
History is preserved.

---

## 4. Agents Suggest, Engines Decide
Agents contribute ideas.
The engine enforces truth.

---

## 5. Safety by Construction
Invalid states must be unrepresentable.

---

## 6. Transparent Determinism
Every outcome must be explainable and reconstructible.

---

## 7. Human Authority Is First-Class
Humans pause, approve, and decide.
Waiting is a valid state.

---

## 8. No Hidden Work
No background tasks.
No silent retries.
No eventual outcomes.

---

## 9. Scale by Intent Replication
Scale comes from running more intents,
not from distributing authority.

---

## Final Anchor

> If a feature introduces implicit authority, it does not belong in Converge.
