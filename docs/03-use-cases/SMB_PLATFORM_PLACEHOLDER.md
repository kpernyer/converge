# Converge SMB Platform (Placeholder)
## Business-Native Software for Growing Companies

> **Status:** Placeholder / Vision Document  
> **Purpose:** Keep the business problem real while Converge evolves as open source.

---

## Why This Exists

Converge is being developed as an **open-source convergence engine**.
Its purpose is not to become another agent framework, but to enable a new
category of **business-native software**.

This document exists to anchor Converge in a **real commercial use-case**:
SMBs that are growing and outgrowing spreadsheets, Notion boards, and ad-hoc tools,
but do not want enterprise CRM / ERP systems.

---

## Target User

Growing SMBs (≈10–200 people) that:

- Are scaling sales, marketing, or operations
- Use tools like Notion, Slack, Airtable, Miro, Google Workspace
- Reject heavy systems like Salesforce, SAP, Dynamics
- Move fast and change how they work frequently
- Cannot afford months of configuration or consultants

They do not want:
- templates
- admin-heavy configuration
- rigid workflows

They want:
- clarity
- alignment
- speed
- confidence

---

## Core Thesis

> **Business software should adapt to how a company works — not the other way around.**

Historically:
- software required configuration
- configuration required consultants
- consultants froze the organization

With Converge:
- intent replaces configuration
- constraints replace workflows
- convergence replaces “setup”

---

## What This SMB Platform Is (Conceptually)

This is **not** a single product like “CRM” or “ERP”.

It is a **business capability layer** that covers:
- Sales
- Marketing
- Campaigns
- Customer relationships
- Social presence
- Lightweight operations

All driven by **business intent**, not schemas and settings.

---

## Example: Sales & Growth (Conceptual)

Instead of:
- configuring pipeline stages
- defining automation rules
- maintaining CRM hygiene

A business might say:

> “We want to grow inbound sales, avoid spammy outreach, focus on mid-market,
> and keep a human review before committing budget.”

The system:
- interprets this as intent
- applies constraints
- explores strategies
- converges on options
- pauses for human approval when required

No pipeline setup.
No workflow editor.
No admin UI.

---

## Role of Converge

Converge provides:

- Intent-driven execution
- Explicit constraints and invariants
- Deterministic convergence
- Human-in-the-loop authority
- Explainable outcomes

Converge does **not**:
- define UI
- define domain vocabulary
- define integrations

It is the **alignment and decision core**.

---

## Open Source & Ecosystem

Converge is open source so that:

- small dev studios can contribute domain capabilities
- customers can extend behavior without forking
- the core remains conservative and trustworthy

The SMB platform built on top may include:
- open-core components
- hosted services
- commercial extensions

But Converge itself remains:
- general
- strict
- boring (in the best way)

---

## How Developers Contribute

Developers do not customize “instances”.

They contribute:
- domain agents
- validation logic
- connectors
- capabilities

Reusable, composable, business-semantic components.

---

## How Humans Interact

Humans:
- express intent
- review outcomes
- approve or reject decisions

They do **not**:
- configure workflows
- manage pipelines
- babysit automation

Human authority replaces admin configuration.

---

## Non-Goals (Important)

This platform is not trying to:
- replace every ERP feature
- model every business process
- automate everything

It optimizes for:
- alignment
- adaptability
- trust

---

## Status & Next Steps

This document is intentionally incomplete.

It will evolve into:
- concrete SMB use-cases
- example products
- reference implementations

Its current role is to ensure that:
> **Converge always serves real business problems, not abstract agent experiments.**

---

## One-Sentence Takeaway

> **Converge enables business software that adapts by intent instead of configuration — and this SMB platform is where that promise becomes real.**
