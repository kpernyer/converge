# Jobs to be Done Framework for Converge Use Cases

**Purpose**: Framework for analyzing use cases through the Jobs to be Done lens, capturing Functional, Emotional, and Relational jobs.

**Based on**: Clayton Christensen's Jobs to be Done theory

**Status**: Draft - To be refined through practice

---

## Overview

Every use case should address specific "jobs" that stakeholders need to get done. These jobs fall into three categories:

1. **Functional Jobs**: What the user needs to accomplish (the task)
2. **Emotional Jobs**: How the user wants to feel (the experience)
3. **Relational Jobs**: How the user wants to be perceived (the identity)

---

## Framework Structure

For each use case, we document:

### Functional Jobs
- **Primary Job**: The main task to be accomplished
- **Supporting Jobs**: Tasks that enable the primary job
- **Success Criteria**: How we know the job is done well
- **Constraints**: What limits how the job can be done

### Emotional Jobs
- **Feelings Desired**: How stakeholders want to feel
- **Feelings Avoided**: How stakeholders don't want to feel
- **Trust Factors**: What builds trust
- **Confidence Factors**: What builds confidence

### Relational Jobs
- **Identity Desired**: How stakeholders want to be seen
- **Reputation Factors**: What builds reputation
- **Status Indicators**: What signals status
- **Relationship Goals**: What relationships are being built

## Integration with Use Case Review

This framework should be integrated into the use case review process:

1. **Phase 1**: Document Jobs to be Done
2. **Phase 2**: Validate jobs with stakeholders
3. **Phase 3**: Design solution to address jobs
4. **Phase 4**: Measure success against jobs

---

**Next Steps**:
1. Apply this framework to existing use cases
2. Refine framework based on learnings
3. Create job discovery process
4. Develop measurement approach
