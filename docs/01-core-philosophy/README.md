# Core Philosophy

This directory contains the foundational documents that define what Converge is and why it exists.

## Documents

### [MANIFESTO.md](./MANIFESTO.md)
The core principles of Converge. Read this first to understand the project's identity.

**Key points:**
- Context is the API
- Agents collaborate through data, not calls
- Convergence is mandatory
- LLMs are tools, never authorities

### [TERMINOLOGY.md](./TERMINOLOGY.md)
Normative definitions of terms used throughout Converge documentation and code.

**Use this when:**
- You need precise definitions
- You're writing new documentation
- You're implementing features and need to name things correctly

### [WHEN_TO_USE_CONVERGE.md](./WHEN_TO_USE_CONVERGE.md)
Guidance on when Converge is the right tool, and when other systems are better.

**Key question:** "If you can't clearly state what convergence means, don't use Converge."
