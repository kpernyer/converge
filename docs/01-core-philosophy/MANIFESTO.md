# Converge — Manifesto

Converge exists to make AI systems correct by construction.

- Context is the API
- Agents collaborate through data, not calls
- Convergence is mandatory
- LLMs are tools, never authorities
- Gherkin constrains behavior, it does not control execution

If a system cannot explain why it stopped, it is not finished.
