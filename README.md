# Converge
## A Semantic Engine for Intent-Driven Business Systems

Converge is an open-source **semantic convergence engine**.

It enables systems to move from an initial *intent*
to a stable, explainable outcome by accumulating facts,
enforcing invariants, and converging on truth.

Converge is not an agent framework.
It is not a workflow engine.
It is not event-driven.

It is a system for **alignment**.

## Why Converge Exists

Modern business software fails because:
- configuration replaces intent
- automation hides authority
- workflows fossilize assumptions

Converge replaces:
- configuration → intent
- workflows → convergence
- automation → explainable decisions

---

## Core Concepts

- **Root Intent:** the scope and goal of execution
- **Shared Context:** append-only facts visible to all agents
- **Agents:** deterministic or LLM-backed contributors
- **Convergence:** execution until a fixed point is reached
- **Invariants:** business laws expressed in Gherkin
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** explicit approval and gating

---

## What Makes Converge Different

- Single semantic authority per intent
- No message queues
- No background execution
- No eventual consistency
- Full provenance and auditability

Every outcome can be explained.
