# GKE Placeholder Module

This directory is a placeholder for future GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) infrastructure.

## Phase 2 Strategy
When Converge transitions to a "Long-lived semantic control plane", this module will be implemented to provision:
- A regional GKE Autopilot cluster.
- In-cluster networking for gRPC communication between engines.
- Dedicated resource pools for CPU-bound agent logic.

## Current State
Empty placeholder to maintain the architectural "Phase 2" vision.
